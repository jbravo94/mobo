        </p>

        <p>
          A key responsibility of operating IT services is to ensure backups are properly performed (beside testing regularly the restore process).
          Especially understaffed IT teams most likely suffer from information overload (mails, dashboards, mobile notifications, etc.) where critical information can simply be overlooked.
          mobo supports here as an independent gadget aiming for disrupting the regular cognitive overload to shift attention.
